# Azure Pipelines

Brief notes and considerations when automating infrastructure with [Terraform](https://terraform.io) and [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).

## Overview

### Branch Commit Triggered

| Pipeline | Branch | Terraform Backend | Detects Drift | Deploys |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| [`ci.yaml`](./ci.yaml) | &bull; `feat/*`<br>&bull; `fix/*`  | local | No | No |
| [`cd.yaml`](./cd.yaml) | &bull; `main` <br>&bull; `production` | Azure Storage | No* | Yes  |

_*The CD pipeline does not check for drift because this is checked at the pull request._

### Pull Request Triggered

The following pipelines do CI check and configuration drift detection, and posts the results back to the Pull Request. [See example &rarr;](https://github.com/Azure/devops-governance/pull/27)

| Pipeline | PR Trigger  | Detects Drift | Deploys |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| [`pr-main.yaml`](./pr-main.yaml) | `main` | Yes | No |
| [`pr-production.yaml`](./pr-production.yaml) | `production` | Yes | No |

### Scheduled Triggeed

Checks regularly for any manual non Infrastructure as Code changes.

| Pipeline | Trigger  | Detects Drift | Deploys |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| [`schedule-drift.yaml`](./schedule-drift.yaml) | Scheduled nightly | Yes | No |

## Security Considerations

### Terraform State in Azure Blob Storage 

Terraform state is always in plain text, which is why it is stored in Azure Blob Storage with public access disabled.

- This storage account is NOT managed by Terraform
- This project prefers [Shared Access Signtures (SAS) tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) over [Access Keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal) in order to:
  - Apply principle of least privilege
  - Use short-lived tokens for CI/CD because we trust for headless actors less

### Pipeline Secrets and Azure Key Vault Integration

- Secrets are stored in [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/azure-key-vault?view=azure-devops) and automatically fetched from Key Vault at build [run time](https://azuredevopslabs.com/labs/vstsextend/azurekeyvault/)
- Because variables are encrypted in Azure DevOps, secret variables not automatically decrypted and must be [explictly mapped into the environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#secret-variables) - at every step.

#### Example

| Variable in YAML | Description | Naming Convention |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `kv-tf-state-blob-account` | Name of secret in Key Vault. The `$(â€¦)` macro syntax means it will be fetched and processed into template before pipeline runs. | Custom  `kv-` prefix for easier debugging |
| `$TF_STATE_BLOB_ACCOUNT_NAME` | Mapped environment variable | Linux: uppercase with underscores |


```yaml
variables:
  - group: e2e-gov-demo-kv

steps:
- bash: |    
    terraform init \      
      -backend-config="storage_account_name=$TF_STATE_BLOB_ACCOUNT_NAME" \
      -backend-config="container_name=$TF_STATE_BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME" \
      -backend-config="key=$TF_STATE_BLOB_FILE" \
      -backend-config="sas_token=$TF_STATE_BLOB_SAS_TOKEN"
  displayName: Terraform Init
  env:
    TF_STATE_BLOB_ACCOUNT_NAME:   $(kv-tf-state-blob-account)
    TF_STATE_BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME: $(kv-tf-state-blob-container)
    TF_STATE_BLOB_FILE:           $(kv-tf-state-blob-file)
    TF_STATE_BLOB_SAS_TOKEN:      $(kv-tf-state-sas-token)
```

### Why is there an Azure AD "Superadmins" Group? 

In this example "superadmins" refers to privileged accounts at the organization level, e.g. central IT infrastructure admins.

This project creates Azure Key Vaults, which require access policies for the Data Plane. This means you want to create the Key Vault _and_ give yourself access. 

In order to interact with the Key Vaults' data plane, the we need to [assign ourselves the proper roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli#azure-built-in-roles-for-key-vault-data-plane-operations), e.g. `Key Vault Secrets User` to gain access.
